  <p> Lets start by respecting other fandoms. Yeah I know they did things that are unforgivable but BTS forgot it so why can't we. Fanwars literally just prove that us A.R.M.Y is immature and doesnt know how to stop when it comes to "heliping the boys". I know they do try to trigger us but when we reply it just makes us seem immature not them they are using us and since we are suh a big fandom when we try to comeback wih replies it makes us seem toxic.              </p>
